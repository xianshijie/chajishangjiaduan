Chinese tea culture is a culture of making tea and drinking tea in China. As one of the seven things to open the door (chamy rice oil sauce vinegar tea), drinking tea is very common in ancient China. The tea culture in China is very different from the tea culture in Europe and America or Japan. The Chinese tea culture has a long history and is profound and profound. It not only contains material and cultural aspects, but also contains a profound level of spiritual civilization. The tea ceremony of the tea sacred Lu Yu in the Tang Dynasty blew the horn of the Chinese tea culture in history. Since then, the spirit of tea has infiltrated the court and society, and has penetrated Chinese poetry, painting, calligraphy, religion, and medicine. For thousands of years, China has not only accumulated a lot of material culture about tea planting and production, but also accumulated rich spiritual culture about tea. This is China's unique tea culture.
